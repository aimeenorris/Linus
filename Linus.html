        <h1>All About Linus</h1>
        <img src="Linus.jpg" height=300px class="center" >
        <p>Linus was born on November 26th, 2016. He is now
        <em id="age"></em>
        days old.
        </p>
        <p>We adopted Linus on January 25th, 2017, which means we have had him in our home for
            <em id="adoptedTime"></em> days.
        </p>
        <p> We adopted Linus from <a href="http://cfp-nc.org/">Cause For Paws </a> which is a local
        rescue group for dogs in the Raleigh area. He was found on the street along
        with a brother and sister. Cause for Paws named the trio after characters from
        the Peanuts. We decided to keep Linus' name because we thought it fit him.
    
        Linus is a great dog!
